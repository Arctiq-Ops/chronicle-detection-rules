# Chronicle Detection Rules

This repository contains sample detection rules for use within Chronicle.

Rules within the [soc_prime_rules](soc_prime_rules) directory were created by
SOC Prime and made available to Chronicle Customers.

## Getting Started

Rules can be created within your Chronicle instance by using the Rules Editor.
Simply download the rule from the repository and copy the content of the rule to
the rule editor when creating a new rule.

To automate rule creation, APIs are available to create/update/delete rules.

Detailed instructions can be found in your Chronicle instance under
documentation:

* Detection UI: https://&lt;your chronicle instance&gt;/docs/detection-engine/detection-engine-ui.html
* Detection API: https://&lt;your chronicle instance&gt;/docs/detection-engine/detection-engine-api.html
